This repository explores several concepts linked to **constrained optimization**, with a specific focus on applicability in the context of neural networks. The motivation for this work stems from **OptNet** paper of Amos & Kolter, proposing a solution for QP problems as a layer in neural architectures

The simulations available here provide a flexible tool for implementing differentiale optimization with regards to generally non-linear problem instances. In order to do demonstrate the functionality of the approach, I have developed an autoencoder architecture where the decoding stage is constituted by a parameterized non-linear optimization task
